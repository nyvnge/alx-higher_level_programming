jQuery is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies web development by providing easy-to-use methods for interacting with HTML documents. It makes it effortless to navigate and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, create animations, and perform AJAX requests.

## Getting Started

You can include jQuery in your project by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can download the jQuery library from the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/) and include it locally.

## How to Use

Once jQuery is included in your project, you can start using its powerful features to build interactive web applications.

## Documentation
